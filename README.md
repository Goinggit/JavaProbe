#### 关于JavaProbe:

在甲方的安全建设当中，应用数据收集无疑是非常重要的工作，在所有的应用资产中，Java应用应该是属于问题较多、漏洞较为严重的一种。我写了个简单的工具来收集这些信息，他还有很多问题，开源之后希望和大家可以一起完善下。

做一个Java运行信息收集工具，我思考了很多方案。其中包括了比较边缘的办法，比如全量扫描主机jar文件，扫描pom文件，解析JavaWeb容器的配置文件等，但是感觉这些操作有一些缺点，比如操作比较复杂，对主机的性能操作可能也有影响、获取的数据维度较少后期数据运营分析不方便等等，后来综合考虑，使用了Java Attach API来进行信息的获取(相关的技术文章附在了结尾链接)。


#### JavaProbe使用说明:
	
* 运行环境要求:    

        1. >= jdk1.6,linux主机,安装了runuser(解决用户之间权限问题),root用户运行
        2. 用之前自己做好测试


* 使用方法:

		1.切换至root权限,给JavaProbe.jar文件设置下权限，保证其他用户权限运行的JVM实例可以加载(在/tmp/目录运行最省事了)
		2.执行 java -jar JavaProbe.jar
		3.结果会生成在/tmp/javainfo_result.txt当中,是json格式，根据所需解析存储。

* TODO:

		1.agent class卸载

#### 问题:
	
	问:JavaProbe你有在生产环境部署过吗？	
	答:2017年开始在公司部署了9万+机器,没有对生产环境造成影响。
	Agent类逻辑简单，理论上不会影响正常的业务,但是会在HOOK的JVM实例里面残留Agent的class，目前在解决这个问题。

	问:JavaProbe目前都支持哪些形式开发的Java应用？
	答:常见的都支持比如war部署和springboot打jar包部署等等。

	问:JavaProbe都有啥数据啊？	
	答:虚拟机名称,jdk版本,classpath,运行目录，临时目录，运行用户，导入的jar包，加载的class等等。

	问:JavaProbe为啥要用root啊？
	答:因为不同用户权限的JVM之间是有隔离的，并不能跨权限HOOK，root用户是为了使用runuser来用不同的用户权限hook用户自己的JVM实例。

	问:我还是不太明白JavaProbe可以用来干啥？
	答:
        1.可以排查存使用了存在漏洞版本的第三方组件的Java应用(应急响应)
        2.统计内网Java应用状态(指纹识别)
        3.处理遗留旧漏洞(定时炸弹) + 开发引用了高风险的服务(比如jolokia)(安全基线)
